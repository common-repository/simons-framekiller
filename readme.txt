Simons FrameKiller adds the framekiller code to a Wordpress page

== Description ==

Simons FrameKiller is a small WordPress plugin that does nothing more than adding the frame killer code to the header of the page.
I created this plugin for a project but thought that perhaps others might want to use it too. The plugin is provided "as is" without warranty.
I am a development worker in South Sudan where I try to help a small NGO with IT. You can read more about me on https://simonspage.de

How to install the plugin:


1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/simons-framekiller` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a frame killer?

Wikipedia: A framekiller (or framebuster or framebreaker) is a technique used by websites and web applications to prevent their web pages from being displayed within a frame. A frame is a subdivision of a Web browser window and can act like a smaller window. A framekiller is usually used to prevent a website from being loaded from within a frameset without permission or as an attack, as with clickjacking.
